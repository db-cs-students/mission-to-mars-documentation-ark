# Process
Gather with your team. Discuss a plan and create a flow chart. Begin creating a prototype. Start programming your microbit. When code is complete, connect the microbits to the same radio group and test the code. Reflect on your case prototype and determine wether you need to print another one or not. When all is complete, you're ready to drop the microbit
